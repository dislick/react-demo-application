# react-demo-application

I wanted to try out React.js and tried to setup a somewhat realistic project. It uses webpack to bundle all dependencies into one nice JavaScript file, obviously supports JSX and has unit tests.

## Available Commands

Start a watch process for development:

```
npm run dev
```

Build and minify everything for production:

```
npm run build
```

Run unit tests:

```
npm test
```

Open `src/client/index.js` in your browser to see the React application!
