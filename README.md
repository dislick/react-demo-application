# react-demo-application

I wanted to try out React.js and tried to setup a somewhat realistic project. It uses webpack to bundle all dependencies into one nice JavaScript file, obviously supports JSX, has unit tests, and uses ESLint.

## Demonstration

### Browser

![demo video](demo.gif)

### Unit Tests

![demo video unit tests](unittests.gif)

## Available Commands

Start a watch process for development:

```
npm run dev
```

Build and minify everything for production:

```
npm run build
```

Run unit tests:

```
npm test
```

Run ESLint:

```
npm run lint
```

Open `src/client/index.html` in your browser to see the React application!
